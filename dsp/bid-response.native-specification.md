# Native Ad Response Markup Details

The structure and contents of the Bid Response are the same as in the OpenRTB standard. The difference is in how the ad creative is returned. The native creative shall be returned as a JSON-encoded string in the adm field of the Bid Object. Note some implementers have chosen to use a direct object in a new field rather than JSON encoded string.

## 1 Object: Native Markup Response

The native object is the top level JSON object which identifies a native response. The native object has following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Require/Optional | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| ver | string | Recommended | "1.2" | Version of the Native Markup version in use. |
| assets | object array | Recommended | - | List of native ad's assets. Required if no assetsurl. Recommended as fallback even if assetsurl is provided. |
| assetsurl | string | Not Supported | - | URL of an alternate source for the assets object. The expected response is a JSON object mirroring the assets object in the bid response, subject to certain requirements as specified in the individual objects. Where present, overrides the asset object in the response. |
| dcourl | string | Not Supported | - | URL where a dynamic creative specification may be found for populating this ad, per the Dynamic Content Ads Specification. Note this is a beta option as the interpretation of the Dynamic Content Ads Specification and how to assign those elements into a native ad is outside the scope of this spec and must be agreed offline between the parties or as may be specified in a future revision of the Dynamic Content Ads spec. Where present, overrides the asset object in the response. |
| link | object | Required | - | Destination Link. This is default link object for the ad. Individual assets can also have a link object which applies if the asset is activated(clicked). If the asset doesn't have a link object, the parent link object applies. See LinkObject Definition |
| imptrackers | string array | Optional | - | Array of impression tracking URLs, expected to return a 1x1 image or 204 response - typically only passed when using 3rd party trackers. To be deprecated - replaced with eventtrackers. |
