# Bid Request

This page describes the bid request format sent from SSPs to Admize.

## Request Header

HTTP headers sent with each bid request:

- `Content-Type`: application/json
- `Content-Encoding`: gzip (Optional)

## 1 Object: BidRequest

The top-level bid request object contains a globally unique bid request or auction ID. This `id` attribute is required as is at least one impression object (Section 4). Other attributes in this top-level object establish rules and restrictions that apply to all impressions being offered.

There are also several subordinate objects that provide detailed data to potential buyers. Among these are the Site and App objects, which describe the type of published media in which the impression(s) appear. These objects are highly recommended, but only one applies to a given bid request depending on whether the media is browser-based web content or a non-browser application, respectively.

## 4 Object: Imp

This object describes an ad placement or impression being auctioned. A single bid request can include multiple Imp objects, a use case for which might be an exchange that supports selling all ad positions on a given page. Each Imp object has a required ID so that bids can reference them individually.

The presence of Banner (Section 6), Video (Section 7), and/or Native (Section 9) objects subordinate to the Imp object indicates the type of impression being offered. The publisher can choose one such type which is the typical case or mix them at their discretion. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

## 5 Object: Metric

This object is associated with an impression as an array of metrics. These metrics can offer insight into the impression to assist with decisioning such as average recent viewability, click-through rate, etc. Each metric is identified by its type, reports the value of the metric, and optionally identifies the source or vendor measuring the value.

| Attribute | Type | Required/Optional | Default | Description |

## 6 Object: Banner

This object represents the most general type of impression. Although the term "banner" may have very specific meaning in other contexts, here it can be many things including a simple static image, an expandable ad unit, or even in-banner video (refer to the Video object in Section 7 for the more generalized and full featured video ad units). An array of Banner objects can also appear within the Video to describe optional companion ads defined in the VAST specification.

The presence of a Banner as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a banner type impression. At the publisher's discretion, that same impression may also be offered as video, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

Video in OpenRTB generally assumes compliance with the VAST standard. As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by optionally including an array of Banner objects (refer to the Banner object in Section 6) that define these companion ads.

The presence of a Video as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a video type impression. At the publisher's discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by optionally including an array of Banner objects (refer to the Banner object in Section 6) that define these companion ads.

The presence of a Audio as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as an audio type impression. At the publisher's discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, video, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types.

## 9 Object: Native

This object represents a native type impression. Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such, the response must be well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.

The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Dynamic Native Ads API. It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad units. This object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads API. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that specification.

The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a native type impression. At the publisher's discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, video, and/or audio by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

The exchange might or might not have knowledge of the page where the content is running, as a result of the syndication method. For example might be a video impression embedded in an iframe on an unknown web property or device.

## 19 Object: Geo

This object encapsulates various methods for specifying a geographic location. When subordinate to a Device object, it indicates the location of the device which can also be interpreted as the user's current location. When subordinate to a User object, it indicates the location of the user's home base (i.e., not necessarily their current location).

The lat/lon attributes should only be passed if they conform to the accuracy depicted in the type attribute. For example, the centroid of a geographic region such as postal code should not be passed.

| Attribute | Type | Required/Optional | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| lat | float | Optional | - | Latitude from -90.0 to +90.0, where negative is south. |

| accuracy | integer | Optional | - | Estimated location accuracy in meters; recommended when lat/lon are specified and derived from a device's location services (i.e., type = 1). Note that this is the accuracy as reported from the device. Consult OS specific documentation (e.g., Android, iOS) for exact interpretation. |
| lastfix | integer | Optional | - | Number of seconds since this geolocation fix was established. Note that devices may cache location data across multiple fetches. Ideally, this value should be from the time the actual fix was taken. |
